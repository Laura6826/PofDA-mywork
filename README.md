  Microsoft Co-Pilot was used to generate ideas of the content of the following notebook. That said, the notebook is mainly my own work, as i had to re-work the code the text in generated to meet my own needs.\

## <span style="color:orange ">1. Introduction <span>

This project is was created as a graded submission for the Programming and Scripting module, as part of the H.Dip in Science in Data Analytics.

The aim of this project is to demonstrate the knowledge to both research and analyis the famous [Palmer Penguins Data Set](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data/master/penguins.csv), using both instruction provided in the lectures, data analysis complete by previous analyists and also based on my own research.

## <span style="color:orange ">2. The purpose of this project <span>

As noted on the [assignment instructions](https://ianmcloughlin.github.io/2324_principles_of_data_analytics/),

The purpose of the assessment is to ensure students can demonstrate the following:

1. Source and investigate sets of data.
1. Programmatically explore and visualize data.
1. Apply basic mathematical data analysis techniques to data sets.
1. Model real-world problems for analysis by computer.
Provide evidence in a decision-making process using a data set.
Appreciate the limitations of graphical representations in data intensive workflows.

## <span style="color:orange ">3. How to get started <span> 

<span style="color:orange "> Necessary software <span> 

In order to run the included files, you will need to ensure that you have access to the correct softwear. I would recommend downloading the following applications (ensuring sufficent space on your hard drive prior to installation):

1. Anaconda (if Anaconda is too large, miniconda would also suffice).
2. Visual Studio Code (this is a code editor).

If installing packages is not an option, you can use the following clickable 'badge', generated in [openincolab.com](https://openincolab.com/) to access the Juypter notebook 'penguins.ipynb', associated with the project.

<span style="color:orange "> Recommended libraries <span> 

For a seamless excutition, I would also recommend you have access to the below libraries prior to running the files:
```
  import pandas as pd
  import numpy as np
  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
  import seaborn as sns
```

<span style="color:orange "> Additions to *.gitignore*<span> 

A number of [additional files](https://github.com/github/gitignore/tree/main/Global) were added to my .gitignore prior to running the programmes:

```
  1. python.gitignore
  2. macOS..gitignore
  3. VisualStudioCode.gitignore
  4. Linux.gitignore
  5. TeX.gitignore
  6. Vim.gitignore
```
