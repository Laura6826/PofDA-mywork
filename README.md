## Introduction

This project is was created as a graded submission for the Programming and Scripting module, as part of the H.Dip in Science in Data Analytics.

The aim of this project is to demonstrate the knowledge to both research and analyis the famous [Palmer Penguins Data Set](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data/master/penguins.csv), using both instruction provided in the lectures and also based on research complete by previous analyists.

## Use of this project

## How to get started

In order to run the included files, you will need to ensure that you have access to the correct softwear. I would recommend downloading the following applications (ensuring sufficent space on your hard drive prior to installation):

1. Anaconda (if Anaconda is too large, miniconda would also suffice).
2. Visual Studio Code (this is a code editor).

If installing packages is not an option, you can use the following clickable 'badge', generated in [openincolab.com](https://openincolab.com/) to access the Juypter notebook 'penguins.ipynb', associated with the project.

the appropriate libraries are available for use. For a seamless excutition, I would recommend you have access to the below libraries prior to running the files:

### Note

A number of [additional files](https://github.com/github/gitignore/tree/main/Global) were added to my .gitignore prior to running the programmes:
    :animate: fade-in  # Makes the text fade into picture
    :color: primary  # Makes the dropdown green instead of grey

    1. python.gitignore
    2. macOS..gitignore
    3. VisualStudioCode.gitignore
    4. Linux.gitignore
    5. TeX.gitignore
    6. Vim.gitignore
